% init_muscle_force_equilib calculates the sum of all forces in the MTC
% model. This function is required to identify l_CE length with
% force-equilibrium at the internal degree of freedom. It is used to
% calculate the initial conditions (integrator constant) for dot_l_CE. 
%
% Any changes to the MTC model's force equation have to be applied here
% too.
