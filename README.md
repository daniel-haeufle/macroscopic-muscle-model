macroscopic-muscle-model
========================

Open-Source macroscopic (Hill-type) muscle model for forward-dynamic simulations in biophyiscs and biomechanics. 

This model is the further development of a model published in

D.F.B. Haeufle, M. Günther, A. Bayer, S. Schmitt, Hill-type muscle model with serial damping and eccentric force–velocity relation, Journal of Biomechanics, Volume 47, Issue 6, 11 April 2014, Pages 1531-1536, ISSN 0021-9290, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiomech.2014.02.009.

The newest version also allows for the calculation of energy expenditure:
